# Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Heart Disease Classification** project! This repository contains all the resources you need to understand, run, and evaluate a machine learning model for classifying heart disease.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- **[Presentation Slides](./Heart_Disease_Classification_Presentation.pptx):** A comprehensive PowerPoint presentation explaining the project's objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- **[Jupyter Notebook](./Heart_Disease_Classification.ipynb):** An interactive notebook that walks you through the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **[Dataset](./heart_disease_data.csv):** The dataset used for training and evaluating the model.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/resu2003/Heart-Disease-Classification-using-ML.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```sh
cd Heart-Disease-Classification-using-ML
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Explore the Dataset
Open the CSV file to get a sense of the data you'll be working with. The dataset contains various health metrics that will be used to predict heart disease.

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook to start exploring and running the machine learning model.

```sh
jupyter notebook Classification & Prediction.ipynb
```
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.


## 📊 Project Overview
### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether a patient has heart disease based on several health metrics.

### Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
- Model Selection: Trying out different machine learning algorithms to find the best fit.
- Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate the model's performance.
- Optimization: Tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's accuracy.

### Results
- Check out the presentation slides for a detailed analysis of the results and insights gained from this project.
